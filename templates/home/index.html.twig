                <p>Hello!</p>
                <p class="lh-base">This is my attempt to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on database with Symfony 5 & PHP 8. <br>
                    You can add, edit, delete any of the data, I have the original database so I can reset it anytime. You can add Category/Subcategory/Thread/Post and Up Vote/Down Vote while you logged in and you can delete your post. <br>
                    However, the free Heroku plan that I'm using gives <i>limited number of SQL queries per hour</i>. So if you lose connection to the database, you may have surpassed the limit and you have to wait another hour to be able to access the database. <br>
                    If you want to log in without registering:<br>
                    email: test1@mail.com<br>
                    password: pomme1<br>
                    You can find the code source on my <a class="text-dark" href="https://github.com/ahidayati/exam-symfony">GitHub Repo</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Cheers,<br>Annisa</p>
